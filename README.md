Data Analysis Using MATLAB
Calculate the principal components of a dataset of 5000 images of faces of famous people, taken from a public repository. Each image is a 32x32 matrix of pixel which has been linearized into a vector of size 1024.
These images are contained in the file pcafaces.mat
Projecting the high dimensional data onto (a smaller space defined by) a few principal components and recovering the original high dimensional data by re-projecting back the projected data onto the
original space.
